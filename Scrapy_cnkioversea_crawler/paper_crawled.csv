"The theory of yun-qi in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), also known as five evolutive phases and six climatic factors, involves a lot about prevention and treatment of epidemic diseases as discussed in Wen Yi Lun and Wen Bing Tiao Bian. This paper attempts to analyze the background of the pathogenesis of COVID-19, China from the perspective of five evolutive phases and six climatic factors, and then puts forward the diagnosis and treatment ideas. First of all, from the perspective of “wenli”, the sixth time period of 2019 (December 7, 2019 to February 4, 2020) was prone to the outbreak of serious infectious diseases (wenli), and the first attack was likely to be in the central region of China (zai wugong). Secondly, from the perspective of “recovery of qi”, in 2019, the spleen-earth qi was insufficient, so the surpassing qi was liver-wood qi, and the payback qi was lung-metal qi. This reminds us the dryness pathogenic factor of the six climatic conditions should be paid attention to in clinical diagnosis and treatment of epidemic diseases. Thirdly, from the perspective of “the suitable medicine and food”, the payback qi in 2019 (ji-hai year) is lung-metal qi and the lung-metal qi in 2020 (geng-zi year) is too much, so it is advisable to use herbs of bitter-warm, pungent-warm and sour-warm property. In addition, the confirmatory analysis has been done based on the current information about COVID-19, the Diagnosis and Treatment Plan for Corona Virus Disease 2019 (Trial Version 5) published by National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China which includes the symptoms, TCM syndrome types and the TCM prescriptions in each stage of the treatment, as well as the similar researches on the SARS in 2003 (gui-wei year). This article aims at providing some thoughts on the prevention and treatment of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by means of traditional Chinese medicine."	金锐	623	医学争鸣	Negative	five evolutive phases and six climatic factors; yun-qi theory; COVID-19; wenli; traditional Chinese medicine;	http://new.oversea.cnki.net/kcms/detail/61.1481.R.20200219.0930.002.html	从五运六气角度探讨新型冠状病毒肺炎的发病、诊断及治疗	"Discussion on pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 from the perspective of five evolutive phases and six climatic factors"

"Author’s previous “activity theory of meridian therapy” predicated that therapeutic effects of meridian therapy could be related to the restoration of inhibited acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity by either acupuncture or action of AChE activators. The application of AChE activators instead of acupuncture can have acupuncture-like or even better therapeutic effects, including anti-infection effects. The author named it “activator therapy” and designed several forms of the drug for different occasions. It is suggested for the authority to adopt various suitable preparations designed by him after test in this current anti-COVID-19 battle."	林真	624	医学争鸣	Negative	N/A	http://new.oversea.cnki.net/kcms/detail/61.1481.R.20200218.2300.002.html	胆碱酯酶激动剂用于新型冠状病毒肺炎辅助治疗的尝试	An attempt to use cholinesteraseactivators forassistant treatment of COVID-19

"Novel coronavirus pneumonia(NCP) is highly infectious and seriously harmful to human health. According to the clinical characteristics of NCP, it can be classified into mild, moderate, severe and critical ones. The treatment for critical cases is an important factor of reducing the mortality rate of the disease and is always dependent on the intensive care unit(ICU). The ICU therapy strategies involve not only curing the critical cases, but also avoiding cross infection in the same ward. Therefore, we have formulated detailed response management strategies, including the establishment of core groups, standardization of diagnosis and treatment process, strengthening personnel management, multimodal training assessment, and overall allocation of protection materials. We hope the strategies can provide reference for relevant ICUs."	申存毅;谭文君;李希;张靖;刘青光;刘昌;仵正;王铮	987	西安交通大学学报(医学版)	Journal of Xi’an Jiaotong University(Medical Sciences)	intensive care unit; 2019-nCov; management;	http://new.oversea.cnki.net/kcms/detail/61.1399.r.20200224.0944.014.html	重症监护病房应对新型冠状病毒感染的管理对策	Management of novel coronavirus infection in ICU
"Objective To construct an information system for preview and triage during novel coronavirus pneumonia(NCP) epidemic time in stomatological hospitals and put it to clinical use. Methods To sort out and formulate the preview and triage process of stomatological hospitals during the epidemic, we constructed B/S development platform with Jeesite open source framework, sort outed and developed relevant input and query functions. ActiveX widget was used to connect the hardware part with the ID card reader through the browser. At the initial stage of the system put online, the parallel mode of manual registration and system registration was used to verify the actual effect of the system. Results After the system went online, the triage data of 35 patients were analyzed. The average triage time was shortened from(90.82±31.85) seconds to(38.97±12.14) seconds, with an efficiency increase of about 125%.

"Since the end of 2019, the novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) has rapidly spread in Wuhan City, Hubei Province of China. This has aroused great concern of the Chinese government and the international community. There have been unconfirmed threads of COVID-19 patients with conjunctivitis as the first symptom. Therefore, the issue that whether and how the novel coronavirus strain 2019-nCoV infection is transmitted through the ocular surface has become a new concern. In the absence of clinical and experimental evidence of 2019-nCoV in ocular infection, we have conducted a retrospective literature analysis of viral pathogens that simultaneously trigger ocular lesions during the onset of epidemic diseases. The purpose of this paper is to provide some reference and suggestions for appropriately understanding of ocular protection in the prevention and control of the COVID-19."	张铭志	1052	国际眼科杂志	International Eye Science	N/A	http://new.oversea.cnki.net/kcms/detail/61.1419.R.20200223.1432.002.html	关注新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎 (COVID-19）与眼表传播问题	New coronavirus pneumonia and ocular surface transmission

"Objective: We know that the new corona virus( Corona Virus Disease 2019,COVID-19) can enter host cells through angiotensin-converting-enzyme Ⅱ( ACE2) cell receptors. And previous studies have shown that ACE2 mRNA is normally expressed in digested system cells. But the expression of ACE2 protein in normal digestive system,the expression of ACE2 mRNA and its protein in digestive system tumors have not been reported. Therefore,this article aims to explore the expression of ACE2 in digestive tract and its tumors,in order to provide a reference for the prevention and treatment of patients with digestive system tumors. Methods: The expression of ACE2 mRNA and protein in digestive system tumors was analyzed by GEPIA online analysis website and HPA database. Results: Among all normal tissues,there were high expression levels of ACE2 mRNA and protein in digestive tract tissues. Among all tumor tissues,there were also high expression levels of ACE2 protein in digestive tract tumors. The expression of ACE2 mRNA in lung,colon,esophageal and gastric cancers was higher than that in normal tissues,and the expression of ACE2 mRNA in colon and gastric cancers was statistically significant than their normal tissues. In addition,the expression of ACE2 mRNA was also higher in colon and gastric cancers than lung cancer. Conclusion: The expression of ACE2 is relatively higher in human digestive system. This result provides some evidence for the transmission of digestive system,which may be the infection route of COVID-19. And the expression of ACE2 in patients with gastrointestinal tumors is higher than their normal tissues. In order to prevent this possible infection route of the digestive system,the protection of patients with gastrointestinal cancer should be paid great attention."	张明鑫;路宁;王佳;朱琳;崔曼莉	679	现代肿瘤医学	Journal of Modern Oncology	N/A	http://new.oversea.cnki.net/kcms/detail/61.1415.R.20200218.1020.002.html	新型冠状病毒细胞受体血管紧张素转化酶Ⅱ在消化道及其肿瘤中的表达	Expression analysis of COVID-19 cell receptor ACE2 in digestive tract and its tumors
"Following the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome corona virus (MERS-CoV), another highly pathogenic corona virus called SARS-CoV-2 (previously known as 2019-nCoV) has caused pandemic pneumonia named COVID-19 in China and has been putting the whole world on alert since December 2019. SARS-CoV-2 shares highly homological sequence and similar pathogenesis with SARS-CoV, and makes use of the same receptor as SARS-CoV for its invasion. The receptor of SARS-CoV is distributed widely on the cell membrane of neurons as well as on the mucous membrane of the respiratory tract and alveolar epithelial cells. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 may also have similar neuroinvasion ability. Based on the public data, the most distinctive symptom of COVID-19 patients is respiratory distress, and most patients admitted to the intensive care could not breathe spontaneously. In addition, some COVID-19 patients did show neurologic signs such as headache, nausea and vomiting. It is quite likely that its potential neuroinvasion is one cause leading to the SARS-CoV-2-induced respiratory failure. Importantly, some corona viruses have been shown able to spread to the brain stem via the respiratory mechano- and chemoreceptors in the lung and lower respiratory airways, and subsequently destroy the central neurons in charge of respiratory sensation and movement in experimental animals. It is presumed that the neuroinvasion ability of SARS-CoV-2 may be the one cause of respiratory distress developing in severe COVID-19 patients. It is important to be aware of the potential neuroinvasion of SARS-CoV-2 for the prevention and treatment of the COVID-19-related respiratory distress."	李艳超;白万柱;端川勉	965	医学争鸣	Negative	SARS-CoV-2; neuroinvasion; respiratory distress syndrome;	http://new.oversea.cnki.net/kcms/detail/61.1481.r.20200225.0817.002.html	潜在的神经侵袭特性可能是新型冠状病毒肺炎患者呼吸窘迫的原因之一	Potential neuroinvasion may be one cause of respiratory distress in COVID-19 patients

"Rapid and accurate detection of contagium virus is a key tool for controlling the outbreak. As the number of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus(2019-nCoV or SARS-CoV-2) pneumonia is increasing and the epidemic is spreading, many hospitals, laboratories and pharmaceutical companies have developed diagnostic reagents that can detect SARS-CoV-2. Currently, genome sequencing or real-time PCR is the approach to detect SARS-CoV-2. However, there have been reported the clinical patients with pneumonia of negative results by SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection but positive on the radiological CT scan.. It brings new challenges to the clinical practitioners since it is unclear for the specificity of CT to diagnose the 2019-nCoV pneumonia(NCP). Therefore, how to improve the diagnostic efficiency and the sensitivity of molecular detection remains to be solved. To analyze the variations in viral genomic sequence may be helpful in guiding the prevention and treatment of diseases infected by SARS-CoV-2. At present, controversy still exists over the source of SARS-CoV-2 even though the probable origin is bat in nature. This article summarizes the recent findings of SARS-CoV-2 from genetic, virological and evolutionary biological perspectives. By comparing the genomic variations among SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, we hope the findings can be used in the viral detection and potential antiviral therapy. Also, it will be great if we can trace the spread of the virus from one person to another, which will be a much effective way to predict and control the spread from the virus-carrier without symptoms at the incubation period to the others."	熊子军;张;王雅琦;朱德芹;郭佑民	1003	西安交通大学学报(医学版)	Journal of Xi’an Jiaotong University(Medical Sciences)	N/A	http://new.oversea.cnki.net/kcms/detail/61.1399.R.20200224.0933.008.html	新型冠状病毒基因组变异与诊断	Genomic variations of SARS-COV-2 and detection
"Since December 2019, a number of patients with pneumonitis infected by the novel coronavirus(SARS-CoV-2) have been detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, as the center. The initial reported patients were mainly middle-aged and elderly, and children had low incidence and were not susceptible. As the number of children infected gradually increased, the infection spread to premature babies, infants and young children, and severe cases in children have now occurred. Susceptibility characteristics of the entire population have been identified in the latest diagnosis and treatment plan. At present, the proportion of children affected by the disease is relatively low, but it still deserves enough attention. The epidemiology of novel coronavirus pneumonia in children and adults is unclear, and there is no specific drug for treatment, which brings great difficulties to epidemic prevention and control and clinical treatment. Early identification of epidemiological characteristics and effective treatment with drugs are the key to preventing and controlling this new epidemic.

Results Ten patients(6 men and 4 women) aged 22 to 70 years met the criteria. Of the 10 patients, 8 presented with fever and dry cough; 9 had external or subpleural areas of bilaterel or unilateral lobes and the lesions were in the process of dynamic change. Meanwhile, the lesions had the characteristics of multifocality and diversity. Bronchial inflation signs, enlarged vascular lumens and blood vessel penetration sign were common while pleural effusion was rare. Conclusion The appearance of NCP had certain characteristics.

"In December 2019, a number of patients with pneumonia of unknown cause were found in Wuhan, China. At the initial stage, it was suspected that the disease was related to the history of exposure to a seafood wholesale market in Wuhan. Through deep sequencing of the virus, it was found that it was a kind of coronavirus that had never been seen before. The World Health Organization defined it as 2019 novel coronavirus, or 2019-nCoV for short. The virus is highly infectious. CT scanning of the chest plays an important role in screening and initial diagnosis of the disease. Radiographers have become the most vulnerable first-line group after fever clinic, infection department and intensive care unit. This paper first analyzes the difficulties in radiographers’ sensitivity control and their working characteristics.

"Objective To evaluate the mental health status of students aged 8 to 18 during the period of home isolation during the prevalence of novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP), so as to provide a basis for psychological counseling for students in special periods. Methods A total of 396 students aged from 8 to 18 were assessed for anxiety/depression by Questionnaire Star survey on February 6th to 8th, 2020. All subjects filled out general information and the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders(SCARED) were analyzed for the impact of NCP on children’ and adolescents’ mood and anxiety during home isolation. Results 1) The total score of SCARED in 396 students was 16.44±12.30, 87 (22.0%) with scores≥25 and 309 (78.0%) with scores＜25. The mean scores of 5 factors(somatization/panic, generalized anxiety, dissociative anxiety, social phobia and school phobia) and the total scores were compared between the two groups, and the differences were statistically significant (t=13.156, 19.524, 10.381, 13.964, 7.325, 23.371, P＜0.001). 2) Binary Logistic regression analysis showed that female students (OR=2.258, 95%CI:1.370―3.721, P＜0.001) and considering themselves in danger (OR=1.978, 95%CI :1.185―3.301, P=0.009) were risk factors for anxiety among students isolated at home during the epidemic.

"Objective To investigate the temporal variation of the clinical symptoms, nucleic acid detection and CT characteristics of novel coronavirus pneumonia(NCP) patients with clustered onset in families. Methods We made a retrospective analysis of the NCP patients(4 males and 3 females) with clustered onset in 3 families diagnosed in The First Affiliated Hospital of Xi’an Jiaotong University from January 27 to February 1, 2020. We analyzed the clinical data and CT findings. Results The CT signs in the three groups of families were consistent with early manifestations: multiple ground-glass opacity(GGO), under the pleura in both lungs, with or without thickening of small pulmonary vessels. In the first group, two people were confirmed with positive nucleic acid in the first diagnosis. The wife was asymptomatic, but the CT finding was positive. Her husband was symptomatic, and the first CT result was negative, but the CT was positive two days later. In the second group, the spouses had the onset at the same time, and both CT and nucleic acid were positive. In the third group, all the three people had the onset at the same time, and the CT results were all positive, but the son was diagnosed only after the third nucleic acid test, and the other two were positive at the first diagnosis. Conclusion There are time differences in clinical symptoms, nucleic acid detection, and CT manifestations of NCP in the early stage. These differences may be an important underlying factor for the spread of the disease.

"Since December 2019, an outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) has spread across China successively. Approved by the State Council, the National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China has classified it into category-B infectious diseases in the list of the People’s Republic of China on the prevention and control of infectious diseases, and has regarded it as category-A infectious diseases in terms of the prevention and control measures on January 20th, 2020. Successive series of prevention and control measures was conducted such as isolating patients and medical observation of their close contacts. The gathering of vaccination units may increase the risk of spread and infection of the NCP, so that children and their guardians are placed under home quarantine, which will results in delayed vaccination. Children’s guardians and health care staff in primary health care institutes are in great need of knowing the immunogenicity and safety of delayed vaccination and the priority of vaccination after recovery of outpatient service. On the basis of the literature review of guidelines and a large number of literature at home and abroad, experts of Group for Disease Prevention and Vaccination, Society of Child Health, Chinese Preventive Medicine Association analyzed the influence of all kinds of different inoculum time and procedures on the safety and immunogenicity of vaccination, hoping to provide scientific evidence and professional advice in time the and eliminate anxiety panic of child guardians and confusion of vaccination workers on the front line concurrently."	王琳;白云骅;方拴锋;江蕙芸;谢露	234	中国儿童保健杂志	Chinese Journal of Child Health Care	N/A	http://new.oversea.cnki.net/kcms/detail/61.1346.R.20200210.1532.002.html	新型冠状病毒肺炎流行期间疫苗延迟接种安全性和有效性分析及接种建议（第一版）	"Immunization recommendations and immunogenicity and safety on the delayed vaccination during the prevalence of the novel coronavirus pneumonia in China Society of Child Health, Chinese Preventive Medicine Association"
"Objective To understand and explore the depression status and its influencing factors among children and adolescent students during the prevalence of novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP), in order to provide reference for the psychological intervention for students in this area. Methods A self-designed general data questionnaire and Depression Self-rating Scale for Children (DSRS) were typed in www.wjx.cn. And the questionnaire was sent out to children and adolescent aged 8 to 18 years by Wechat APP from February 6th to 8th, 2020. Univariate and multivariate analysis were used to analyze the influencing factors associated with NCP by SPSS 22.0 software. Results Totally 396 valid questionnaire were returned. The average score of DSRS score was 7.35±5.10. Using 15 as the cut point of having depression symptoms, it was found that 41 students (10.4%) had depression symptoms obviously, and 355(89.6%) students scored less than 15. Multivariate analysis showed that anxiety score, dwelling area, fear of the NCP prevalence and age were influencing factors of DSRS score(P＜0.05). Logistic analysis indicated that anxiety(OR=4.284, 95%CI: 2.163～8.486, P＜0.001), dwelling in suburban and rural areas(OR=2.382, 95%CI: 1.120～5.069, P=0.024), and fear of NCP related events(OR=3.312,95%CI：1.210～9.064, P=0.020) were risk factors for depression of children and adolescent with home quarantine. Conclusion Psychological intervention should be strengthen in children and adolescents by family, school and the society, so as to reduce the panic and anxiety in children. Moreover, it is suggested to give more concern to older children in high grade as well as child and adolescent dwelling in suburban and rural areas, thereby reducing the depression of them during the NCP prevalence."	王悦;杨媛媛;李少闻;雷晓梅;杨玉凤	458	中国儿童保健杂志	Chinese Journal of Child Health Care	N/A	http://new.oversea.cnki.net/kcms/detail/61.1346.R.20200218.1248.002.html	新型冠状病毒肺炎流行期间居家儿童青少年抑郁情绪调查及影响因素分析	Investigation on the status of influencing factors for depression symptom of children and adolescents with home quarantine during the prevalence of novel coronavirus pneumonia
"Since December 2019, the novel coronavirus (2019-nCov) associated infection/pneumonia has emerged in Wuhan, Hubei in China. The State Council made arrangements for the prevention and control of the outbreak with strategies typically used for category-A infectious diseases even though the outbreak has been classified as a category-B infectious disease. With the progress of the outbreak, more cases of the novel coronavirus infection/pneumonia in children have been reported.

Such cases have also been found in other parts of the country and abroad. The spread of the new coronavirus(2019-nCoV) pneumonia epidemic has brought great challenges to the clinical practice of thoracic surgery. Outpatient clinics need to strengthen the differential diagnosis of ground glass opacity and pulmonary plaque shadows. During the epidemic, surgical indications are strictly controlled, and elective surgery is postponed. Patients planning to undergo a limited period of surgery should be quarantined for 2 weeks and have a negative nucleic acid test before surgery can be performed. For patients who are planning to undergo emergency surgery, nucleic acid testing should be carried out before surgery, and three-level protection should be performed during surgery. Surgical disinfection and isolation measures should be strictly carry out. Among postoperative patients, cases with new coronavirus infection were actively investigated.

"A novel coronavirus pneumonia outbreak began in Wuhan, and it spread to the whole country and some overseas regions in a very short time. The population outflow of the outbreak center in Wuhan has a greatly impact on the epidemic spread in other regions. In this paper, we provide a statistical analysis of population movements leaving Wuhan based on mass population movement information which collected by geographic services of Tencent and Baidu. Firstly, we find that the five million people leaving Wuhan before the official announcement that they will close the exits are not much different from the normal population movement during the previous Spring Festival travel rush. However, small portion of the population poured out of Wuhan in the last period before the exits closed. Secondly, according to statistics of the destination cities of the outflow population from Wuhan starting from 2020, we find that the destination distribution of folks in 2020 was basically same as that in previous years. Finally, the influence of the population leaving Wuhan on epidemic spread was analyzed. We find that the role of incubation period must be considered when measuring this influence. This study is helpful for relevant personnel to grasp the speed of epidemic spread, assess the risk of epidemic, and provide reference to predict and stop disease spreading."	许小可;文成;张光耀;孙皓宸;刘波;王贤文	452	电子科技大学学报	Journal of University of Electronic Science and Technology of China	novel coronavirus pneumonia; population mobility; 2019-nCoV; geographical big data;	http://new.oversea.cnki.net/kcms/detail/51.1207.T.20200213.2002.002.html	新冠肺炎爆发前期武汉外流人口的地理去向分布及影响	The Geographical Destination Distribution and Effect of Outflow Population of Wuhan When the Outbreak of the 2019-nCoV Pneumonia

"Objective The epidemic of novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) in Guangdong Province during January 19, 2020 and February 7, 2020 was evaluated to provide evidence for the prevention and control of the NCP outbreak. Methods The data were obtained from the NCP announcement published on the official websites of the health commission of Guangdong Province. Statistical description and statistical analysis were performed based on the resident population of each city in Guangdong Province at the end of 2018. Spearman rank correlation analysis was conducted with the Baidu migration index and daily incidence in Guangdong Province. ArcGIS 10.6 software was used to map the spatiotemporal distribution of confirmed cases in Guangdong Province. Results By February 7, 2020, the cumulative incidence of NCP in Guangdong was 0.95/100,000, the proportion of severe/critical cases was 11.35%, and the cumulative discharged proportion was 9.02%. There was one case died, with a fatality rate of 0.09%. The incidence was 1.01/100,000 in females and 0.89/100,000 in males, with statistically significant differences (RR=1.14, 95%CI: 1.01-1.28, P < 0.05). The cumulative confirmed cases in Guangdong were mainly distributed in Shenzhen (32.65%), Guangzhou (27.72%) and Zhuhai (7.63%). The cumulative incidence in Zhuhai (4.34/100,000) and Shenzhen (2.69/100,000) was higher than that in other cities (P < 0.05). The daily number of new cases in each city has begun to decrease and the overall trend was downward. There was a positive correlation between daily morbidity and 3-day-before migration index in Guangdong Province (correlation coefficient 0.60, P < 0.05). Conclusion In this study, we described the changes of daily confirmed new cases and applied the correlation analysis of the Baidu migration index. It indicated that the progress of the NCP outbreak in Guangdong Province had slowed down and the epidemic had been partly controlled. However, the prevention and control measures should be continued to constrain the scale of population flow, and it is important to strengthen the surveillance and management of suspected cases as well as the people who returned to Guangdong Province."	王宣焯;廖聪慧;李志慧;胡欢;程晓敏;李芊U;陆家海	404	热带医学杂志	Journal of Tropical Medicine	Novel coronavirus pneumonia; epidemic; Guangdong Province; Spatiotemporal distribution;	http://new.oversea.cnki.net/kcms/detail/44.1503.R.20200213.0806.002.html	广东省新型冠状病毒肺炎早期流行与时空分布情况初步分析	Preliminary analysis on the early epidemic and spatiotemporal distribution of new coronavirus pneumonia in Guangdong Province
"At present, the prevention and control of the new coronavirus infected pneumonia in 2019 has entered a critical period. Most of the patients started with respiratory symptoms such as fever and / or cough, but some patients had diarrhea or no symptoms. According to the current research results, the virus can not only infect the respiratory system, but also the digestive system. For this reason, our team suggests that we should expand the screening scope of patients with new coronavirus infection, and carry out epidemiological investigation on patients with diarrhea and other digestive system symptoms in non-febrile outpatient and inpatient departments, so as to find those who may have missed the investigation and provide scientific basis for more active and efficient control of the transmission of new coronavirus, especially in hospital."	吴晓瑛;刘先治;谭嗣伟;陶金;尉秀清;吴斌	239	热带医学杂志	Journal of Tropical Medicine	N/A	http://new.oversea.cnki.net/kcms/detail/44.1503.R.20200210.0951.002.html	关于“在医疗机构所有非发热门诊及住院部对就诊者进行新型冠状病毒感染的流行病学调查”的建议	Suggestions on Epidemiological Investigation of 2019-nCoV Infection in all Non-Febrile Outpatient and Inpatient Departments of the Hospitals

"Based on the traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) theory of treatment adapted to climate, individuality, and environment and according to the experience of Guangdong practitioners in fighting SARS with Chinese medicine in the year of 2003, the Trial Scheme for Traditional Chinese Medicine in Prevention and Treatment of Novel Coronavirus pneumonia in Guangdong Province was released by Guangdong provincial bureau of traditional Chinese medicine on January 24, 2020. In the trial scheme, the pneumonia caused by novel coronavirus infection is defined as of the plaque, and the exogenous attack of the pestilence contributes its main cause, the pathogenesis is characterized by dampness, heat, blood stasis, toxin, and deficiency. The pestilence enters into the lung through the mouth and nose or directly attacks the middle energizer, and the disease mainly affects the lung, middle energizer, and large and small intestine.The early stage of the disease can be differentiated as dampness stagnation in the lung resulting into the dysfunction of the pivot, and evil heat accumulation in the lung resulting into the failure of lung in dispersing and descending, the middle stage the disease can be differentiated as evil heat obstructing the lung and obstruction of fu-organ qi, and damp-heat accumulation inducing toxin and obstruction of lung qi. In the critical period of the disease, the patients manifest as the syndrome of internal obstruction and external collapse.The convalescence stage of the disease can be differentiated as injury of both qi and Yin with residual evil, and deficiency of both lung and spleen. The treatment for various stages should be based on syndrome differentiation.A number of experts from Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine on February 3, 2020 were invited for the diagnosis and treatment of novel coronavirus pneumonia patients in Wuhan, and satisfactory clinical efficacy has been achieved in two cases by following the principles of the trial scheme.In this article, we made an interpretation of Trial Scheme for Traditional Chinese Medicine in Prevention and Treatment of Novel Coronavirus pneumonia in Guangdong Province and analyzed the two medical cases treated following the suggestion of the experts from Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine."	唐静;姚思梦;褚庆民;吴辉	1006	广州中医药大学学报	Journal of Guangzhou University of Traditional Chinese Medicine	N/A	http://new.oversea.cnki.net/kcms/detail/44.1425.R.20200224.1540.002.html	《广东省新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎中医药治疗试行方案》解读及专家案例分析	Interpretation of Trial Scheme for Traditional Chinese Medicine in Prevention and Treatment of Novel Coronavirus pneumonia in Guangdong Province and Experts’ Medical Case Analysis

Method:“COVID-19”,“Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia” and “traditional Chinese medicine” were combined as searching terms. Baidu search engine was used to collect interview materials of TCM on the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 between December 1,2019 and February 12,2020,which were screened and imported into Nvivo for the procedure of analysis. Results:A total of 37 text and 4 video interview materials were enrolled. The results of software analysis showed that the name and nature of COVID-19 centered on cold-dampness and epidemic toxin based on the perspective of TCM. The etiology emphasized the deficiency of internal vital energy and the excess of external epidemic toxin. The location and pathogenesis of the disease highlighted the viscera of Lung and Spleen and the abnormal of Qi respectively. Stages of COVID-19 were mainly divided into early,middle,severe and convalescent stage,which was guided with different pathogenesis and syndromes of TCM. Prevention and control of TCM could be categorized into individualized treatment based on the syndrome differentiation and grouped treatment based on common prescriptions. Some TCM prescriptions and Chinese herb decoction played an important role with the highly acknowledgement from experts,patients and the government.TCM also paid attention to the psychological guidance, creating conditions for the rehabilitation of patients. Researchers of TCM took the initiative to voice their opinions and conduct rational analysis when they faced doubts,guiding the public and stabilizing the social mind effectively. TCM gathered the strength to overcome the COVID-19 through their good efficacy.

This special situation has a certain impact on the transport and treatment process of patients with acute myocardial infarction(AMI). We need to make adjustments in the management of patients with AMI at this particular time. However, AMI is acute, fatal, the optimal treatment window period is short, and easily combined with respiratory infection and respiratory, circulatory failure, more active treatment on the spot. The Key five principles is Nearby treatment,Safety protection, Priority of thrombolysis, Designated transport, Remote consultation. In order to standardize the management and facilitate the process of the diagnosis and treatment, process and path strategy of AMI are formulated for the general reference. For AMI patients, different treatment strategies are selected based on whether there is a suspected or confirmed possibility of NCP, the onset window of STEMI, and whether the vital signs are stable. During the special period,the majority of cardiologists, including interventional physicians, should review the contraindications of thrombolysis and the relevant points of indications. In the transport and treatment of AMI patients, the physicians should firmly grasp the transport indications and protective measurements."	卜军;陈茂;程晓曙;董一飞;方唯一;葛均波;龚艳君;何奔;黄岚;霍勇;贾绍斌;蒋峻;李悦;李昭;梁春;刘学波;刘震宇;马翔;马依彤;钱菊英;沈成兴;沈涤非;沈雳;石瑞正;苏;孙英贤;唐熠达;王建安;吴岳;向定成;徐通达;徐亚伟;杨跃进;曾和松;张澄;张国刚;张瑞岩;张书宁;张运;张钲;郑博;周宁	417	南方医科大学学报	Journal of Southern Medical University	N/A	http://new.oversea.cnki.net/kcms/detail/44.1627.R.20200212.1302.006.html	新型冠状病毒肺炎防控形势下急性心肌梗死诊治流程和路径中国专家共识(第1版)	A Consensus of Chinese experts on the diagnosis and treatment process of acute myocardial infarction under the situation of prevention and control Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia(First Edition)

"Objective To investigate the psychological status of clinical nurses in a class A hospital facing the novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP), in order to provide effective psychological and social intervention. Methods A total of 867 clinical nurses were randomly selected from the Mianyang Central Hospital. The general information questionnaire, standard self-assessment anxiety scale (SAS) and crisis intervention classification assessment scale (TAF) were used to conduct self-assessment questionnaire survey. Then the data were analyzed by the SPSS22.0 software. Results 38.8% of the nurses had a low risk of infection, 18.0% of them had a medium risk, 29.6% had a medium high risk, and 13.6% had a high risk. The SAS scores of clinical nurses in this hospital were statistically significant different, compared with the Chinese norm value (P＜0.05). The difference between TAF score and the degree of crisis response of nursing students in SARS period was statistically significant (P<0.05). The majority of clinical nurses had less crisis response to NCP, with 80.7% of them suffered mild cognitive, emotional and behavioral damage, and only 2.0% suffered severe damage. Analysis of related factors showed that department, self-test risk of infection, length of service had significant influence on SAS and TAF scores of clinical nurses (P<0.05). Conclusion During the period of NCP prevalence, no obvious anxiety and crisis reaction among clinical nurses is found in the third grade hospital. However, the psychological changes of clinical nurses with middle-age, from key epidemic prevention departments and in high risk of self-test infection are more likely to produce anxiety and crisis reaction. Therefore, appropriate and timely psychological intervention should be given."	蒲佳;李桂蓉;曹璐璐;伍苑晨;徐灵琳	642	重庆医学	Chongqing Medicine	N/A	http://new.oversea.cnki.net/kcms/detail/50.1097.R.20200219.2121.006.html	某三甲医院临床护士面对新型冠状病毒肺炎疫情的心理状况调查分析	Investigation and analysis of the psychological status of the clinical nurses in a class A hospital facing the novel coronavirus pneumonia

"ObjectiveTo evaluate the antiviral therapies on severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS) rapidly and systematically, and to explore the clinical feasibility of subcutaneous use of interferon-α in the treatment of 2019-nCoV. MethodsSystematically retrieved relevant clinical studies published in Chinese and English from databases, such as CNKI, VIP, Wangfang, CBM, PubMed, Cochrane Library,et al. In addition, the website of WHO, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of United States, and National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of Chinawere retrieved, so as to search the relevant diagnosis, treatment programsand the relevant references. According to evidence-based pharmacy, evidence evaluation and data extraction were carried out. ResultsA total of 1502 articles were retrieved and 11 studies of them were included finally. The result showed: ① The early use of subcutaneous interferon-α should be within 48 hours after the diagnosis of coronavirus infection. With the prolongation ofmedication, cure rate will decrease, so the treatment should be as early as possible. ②There was no significant difference in therapeutic effect among different types of interferon. ③Interferon-α combined with ribavirin has been proved to be effective in some studies, but their adverse reactions need to be vigilant. Most of the adverse reactions were tolerable, including hemoglobin decreasing, transaminase increasing and amylase increasing. And most of them did not affect the treatment. ConclusionInterferon-α can be used as an experimental therapy in the antiviral treatment of 2019-nCoV, especially in the newly infected patients. Therefore, randomized controlled trials and real world clinical studies should be carried out as soon as possible to further explore the clinical effect of interferon-αon 2019-nCov."	陈岷;童荣生;边原;舒永全;杨勇;杜姗;李文渊;刘心霞;闫峻峰;龙恩武;何林	314	医药导报	Herald of Medicine	N/A	http://new.oversea.cnki.net/kcms/detail/42.1293.R.20200210.1759.002.html	皮下注射α-干扰素治疗2019年新型冠状病毒的循证快速评估	Evidence-based Rapid Review on Possibility of Treatment of 2019-nCoV with Subcutaneousα-interferon

"ObjectiveTo detect and analyze safety signals of alpha interferon (IFN-α) through data mining methods based on FAERS, in order to provide reference for clinical safe use of IFN-α. MethodsData of FARES from 2004Q1 to 2019Q4 (64 quarters) were downloaded. After drug names standardized by MedEx and adverse events classified by MedDRA, the adverse event report cases with IFN-α as the primary suspect drug was extracted, and the safety signal detection was conducted using PRR and ROR methods. ResultsA total of 2889 adverse event reports with IFN-α as the first suspected drug were gathered. Among them, the male/female ratio was 1.32,and the median age was 55 years old. Reports from doctors accounted for 39.91%. Reports from United States accounted for 58.81%. The main routes of administration reported were subcutaneous, intravenous, and intramuscular, accounting for 43.89%. More than half of the cases did not report the route of IFN-α administration. The number of reported cases of “general disorders and administration site conditions”, “investigations”, “blood and lymphatic system disorders” was relatively large. Among the top 20 signal detected events, “hypophosphataemia” and “blood creatine phosphokinase increase” have not been included in IFN-α specification yet. ConclusionSome high frequency adverse events of IFN-α are similar to the symptoms of novel coronavirus pneumonia.

"The disease attribute of corona virus disease 2019（COVID-19）is plague and toxin. The disease is caused by pestilential qi, excess of pathogenic qi and deficiency of vital qi. The pathogenesis is cold and dampness attacking the lung, and stagnated heat transforming into toxin. The pathogenesis are cold, dampness, heat, poison, stasis and deficiency. The treatment should be based on the reasonable differentiation of symptoms and signs according to the specific stage, strengthening the healthy qi and removing pathogenic factors, so that there is a way out for them. At the early stage of the disease : the pathogenesis of the disease is mainly dampness suppressing the lung and disease involving weifen and qifen. The treatment should be based on eliminating dampness, resolving superficial heat and reducing fever. The prescription of modified Huoxiang Zhengqi Powder combined with Chaige jieji Decoction can be chosen. At the middle stage of the disease: the pathogenesis is mainly the superficies pathogens involving interior and heat-transmission, pathogen hidden in Moyuan. The treatment should be based on removing the internal heat and pathogen removing from Moyuan, and the prescription of Sanxiaoyin and Xiaochaihu Decoction can be chosen. At the critical stage of disease: the pathogenesis of the disease is to close lung blocked by pathogenic toxin, internal blockade and external collapse. The treatment should be clearing heat and removing toxicity, ventilating lung qi and clearing blockade. The patients of internal blockade and external collapse should clear their mind, open their orifices and return yang for rescue. Patients with the lung blocked by pathogenic toxin can be treated by Wuhu Decoction combined with Dingli Dazao Xiefeng Decoction. The patients of internal blockade and external collapse can be treated by Shengmai Yin, Shenfu Decoction combined with Angong Niuhuang Pill.

"Since December 2019, a novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) that originated from Wuhan, China, has spread rapidly not only in China but several countries and regions around the world. At present, there is lack of high-quality evidence to support a drug that is proved clinically effective to treat COVID-19. Lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) is one of the recommended antivirals in the interim guideline issued by National Health Commission of China. However, with limited evidence, clinicians are facing many problems while using this medication in clinical practice, such as absence of detailed instruction in general and special populations, unclear rationale behind recommendations, etc. This article summarized and analyzed existing clinical evidences on the use of LPV/r in patients with SARS and MERS, extrapolated the dosing regimens for adults and pediatrics from referencing existing safety data, and discussed treatment duration, precautions, as well as therapeutic drug monitoring strategies of LPV/r. The purpose of this article is to provide rationales and potential benefits of LPV/r against COVID-19, and to guide clinicians to use LPV/r appropriately when it is chosen to treat COVID-19."	杨耀;高杨杨;邹炎洁;郑瑶	954	中国医院药学杂志	Chinese Journal of Hospital Pharmacy	N/A	http://new.oversea.cnki.net/kcms/detail/42.1204.R.20200225.1458.006.html	超说明书应用洛匹那韦/利托那韦治疗新型冠状病毒肺炎的临床药学指引	Pharmacological recommendations on the off-label use of Lopinavir/ritonavir for treatment of coronavirus disease 2019
"In view of the problems involved in the prevention and treatment of Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia(NCP), the relevant coping strategies are planned:one is the concept of consciousness system, not limited to reductionism; one is the cause of medicine verification, not considering the appearance of virus;one is to determine the etiologic factors based on differentiation, not to consider the morphology of the virus; one is to treat the disease before its pathogenesis, not necessarily to treat corresponding to syndrome. The NCP prevention and cure thought was elaborated.Moreover,we retrieved 226 prescriptions of ancient doctors for nourishing lung, clearing lung, clearing dampness and tonifying spleen, counted the frequency sequence of medicine prescribed by the four treatment laws,determined the common medicine and did parallel cluster analysis ,and extracted the compatibility groups of the Yaodui, Yaosan, Yaowu, Yaolu, etc. to provide reference for NCP prescription.The third was to collect 11 items of the National Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Prevention and Treatment Program in China, divided the 11 groups of treatment prescriptions into four categories: initial stage, intermediate stage, severe stage, and recovery stage, and the frequency of medication and the commonly used medicine was counted; at the same time, 11 groups were compared with each other to calculate the coefficient of difference in order to measure the relationship between them.At the end of the article, a succinct prescription was formed, learning from the sage’s experience, learning the current prevention and treatment programs in various places, and recommending medicines for the group of NCP prevention and stage treatment."	周铭心;王苗	1034	中医学报	Acta Chinese Medicine	N/A	http://new.oversea.cnki.net/kcms/detail/41.1411.R.20200224.1128.002.html	新型冠状病毒肺炎中医防治策略与方药筛选	TCM prevention and treatment strategies and prescription screening of Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia
"Based on the theory of Five Movements and Six Qi from the perspective of the "" Natural Factor "" and the modern lifestyle from the perspective of the "" Human Factor "", the “Natural and Human factors"" of the occurrence of Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (NCP) are analyzed. In this way, the essential countermeasures of traditional medicine to maintain vital Qi and prevent diseases before they occur are put forward. First of all, from the distribution of Five Movements and Six Qi in the year of Jihai and its ""final Qi (Light snow-Heavy snow- Winter Solstice- Lesser Cold)"", it can be seen that when the Tuyun less all the year round with the final Qi Taiyang Hanshui water eventually thwarted, Shaoyang Xianghuo of ""Wrong Timing Qi"" is the external "" Natural Factor "" of the outbreak. Correspondence between human body and natural environment, therefore, the NCP syndrome is closely related to the characteristics of the "" Natural Factor "". Secondly, the internal "" Human Factor "" of the epidemic are the improper diet, the loss nutrition of aponeurotic system and the excessive emotion. In view of this, the two principles of ""keeping up the vital Qi "" and ""avoiding poisonous Qi"" are proposed. The former should be treated with food and drink with restraint , Daoyin, and the latter should be treated with sachets to prevent contamination.

"Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (NCP) is an inflammation caused by 2019 novel Coronavirus(2019-nCoV）.After infection, the patient has fever, cough, fatigue, fat tongue, thick and greasy tongue coating and other symptoms. Chinese medicine believes that NCP belongs to the category of plague. The nature of the disease is dampness-toxicity. The disease is located in the lung and spleen. The pathogenesis is ""dampness, heat, blood stasis, toxin and deficiency"". The infection rate is very fast after the onset of the disease. According to the rules of disease transmission, it can be divided into four stages: acute stage, middle stage, critical stage and recovery stage.

MethodsAccording to the COVID-19 Diagnosis and Treatment Program (Trial) and the COVID-19 Prevention and Control Program (Trial) issued by National Health Commission of China, a field investigation was employed on a case of fever from Wuhan reported by Wenzhou in January 15, 2020; the real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay was performed to detect the nucleic acid of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) from the sputum specimens or throat swabs of the case; the close contacts of the case were tracked down; relevant prevention and control measures were implemented. ResultsThe case had lived in Wuhan for long. On January 4 of 2020, he felt cold and uncomfortable without obvious inducement, and drove back to Wenzhou with his wife. He had fever (up to 39 ℃), cough and expectoration on the next day. On January 9, the chest computed tomographic (CT) scan showed bilateral high-density patchy shadowing with blurred edges. On January 16, his throat swab and sputum samples were collected and sent to Zhejiang Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for detection of SARS-CoV-2. The result turned out to be positive on January 17, then was rechecked and confirmed by Chinese CDC on January 20. Two weeks before the onset of the disease, the patient was engaged in the door-to-door persuasion of installing elevators in an old residential area of Wuhan, and he denied any connection with other COVID-19 cases, markets, (sick or dead) poultry or poultry products. Totally 26 close contacts were identified and kept in quarantine. During this period, three of them developed respiratory symptoms, but were excluded from COVID-19. On the afternoon of January 16, the health system of Zhejiang Province and Wenzhou City launched an emergency plan and implemented a series of prevention and control measures such as isolation and treatment of cases, screening and isolation of close contacts, and public health education.

"Objective: To analyze the dynamic changes of chest CT images of patients with corona virus disease-19 (COVID-19). Methods: Fifty-two cases of COVID-19 were admitted in the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine. The consecutive chest CT scans were followed up for all patients with an average of 4 scans performed per patient during the hospitalization. The shortest interval between each scan was 2 days and the longest was 7 days. The shape, number and distribution of lung shadows, as well as the characteristics of the lesions on the CT images were reviewed. Results: The obvious shadows infiltrating the lungs were shown on CT images in 50 cases, for other 2 cases there was no abnormal changes in the lungs during the first CT examination. Ground-glass opacities (GGO) were found in 48 cases (92.3%), and 19 cases (36.5%) had patchy consolidation and sub-consolidation, which were accompanied with air bronchi sign in 17 cases (32.7%). Forty one cases (78.8%) showed a thickened leaflet interval, 4 cases (7.6%) had a small number of fibrous stripes. During hospitalization, GGO lesions in COVID-19 patients gradually became rare，the fibrous strip shadows increased and it became the most common imaging manifestation. The lesions rapidly progressed in 39 cases (75.0%) within 6-9 days after admission. On days 10-14 of admission, the lesions distinctly resolved in 40 cases (76.9%). Conclusion: The chest CT images of patients with COVID-19 have certain characteristics with dynamic changes, which are of value for monitoring disease progress and clinical treatment."	王锦程;刘锦鹏;王园园;刘伟;陈小群;孙超;沈晓勇;汪启东;吴亚平;梁文杰;阮凌翔	961	浙江大学学报(医学版)	Journal of Zhejiang University(Medical Sciences)	Corona virus disease-19; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; Novel coronavirus infection; X-ray computed tomography; Dynamic;	http://new.oversea.cnki.net/kcms/detail/33.1248.R.20200225.1528.004.html	2019冠状病毒病（COVID-19）患者胸部CT影像学动态变化	Dynamic changes of chest CT imaging in patients with corona virus disease-19 (COVID-19)

"Objective: To explore the application and importance of chest CT in screening novel coronavirus pneumonia(NCP) patients. Methods: A total of 35 NCP patients from the First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University and the Second Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University during January 19 2020 to February 1, 2020. They were divided into CT-positive group(with lung exudation, n=31) and CT-negative group(no lung exudation, n=31). The epidemiological history, clinical symptoms, white blood cell count, and lymphocyte count abnormality in each patient were prospectively recorded. And the clinical features of two groups were evaluated. The location, distribution and morphological characteristics of lesions in CT positive group were investigated. Results: Of 35 NCP patients, CT-positive patients accounted for 88.6%(31/35), a history of the endemic center Wuhan contact accounted for 31.4%(11/35), local confirmed patients contact accounted for 31.4%(11/35), no clear epidemiological history accounted for 41.9%(13/35), fever accounted for 88.6%(31/35), gastrointestinal symptoms accounted for 11.4%(4/35), white blood cell count decreased accounted for 17.1%(6/35), and lymphocyte count decreased accounted for 37.4%(13/35). The median onset time in the CT-positive group was 4 days, which was significantly longer than CT-negative group of 2 days, and the difference was statistically significant(P=0.027). Among the 31 NCP patients with CT-positive, 29(93.5%) had bilateral lung distribution. There were 471 lesions in 31 NCP patients, included 67.3%(318/471) lesions located in the lower lung, and 36.7 %(173/471) in other lung lobes; 75.4%(355/471) in the lung peripheral field, and 76.4%(360/471) in the posterior lung. All lesions, 4.9%(23/471) with halo sign, 1.9%(9/471) with reverse-halo sign, 2.5%(12/471) with paving stone sign. In addition, 12.9%(4/31) of the patients were accompanied by a slight amount of pleural effusion(2 cases bilateral and 2 cases unilateral).

"Although the continuous re-emergence of new coronaviruses (CoVs) have led to three severe pneumonia outbreaks from 2003 to 2020, there are no vaccines and effective therapies to prevent and control these coronaviral pneumonia. From December 2019, novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) caused pneumonia was outbroken in Wuhan, Hubei, China, which is highly contagious and quickly spreads throughout of China, even worldwide. It is urgent to develop anti-viral therapy for controlling these coronaviral disease. Viroporin is a family of viral-encoded pore-forming proteins, which form ion channels on cell membrane and contribute to the pathogenicity. It is one of promising antiviral targets for therapeutics. CoV envelope (E) protein is a small integral membrane protein, which is not only involved in virus assembly and budding, but also forms ion channel on the cell membrane as a viroporin, as well as promotes inflammation by activating inflammasome.

"In order to better prevent and manage suspected patients of 2019 novel coronavirus(2019-nCoV)and avoid secondary infections caused by these potential patients or carriers of the virus,experts from Shanghai Respiratory Clinical Quality Control Center including those assigned to Wuhan specially developed this consensus. This consensus is developed with a special focus on how to do a better job for respiratory clinical quality control,and how to do a better job for respiratory clinics during the secondary2019-nCoV epidemic time.By managing suspected patients through quality control,especially by isolating potential sources of infection,cutting off all transmission routes,and ultimately eliminating cross-infection between physicians and patients,we aimed to eliminate transmission and protect physicians and patients and their families in this special time. The key point of clinical quality control is strict training,including familiarity with diagnostic and treatment guidelines,self-control(including special work clothes and medical masks before serving the patients),and eliminating social events and not touching any risks.Doing better job for respiratory clinics requires disinfection and ventilation,respiratory physicians should also be prepared to do the necessary before-and after-care disinfection and protection. The consultation process requires strict implementation of the guidelines. It is recommended that hospitals equipped with necessary instruments serve patients in their home with Internet of Things or Internet,to minimize the possibility of transmission.It is also recommended to minimize unnecessary examinations as much as possible,points of paying attention to the patient’s examination and admission precautions are also listed,with special circumstances response strategies. In addition,special emphasis is needed to consider 2019-nCoV as an infectious disease. Physicians should not miss the patients or virus-carriers,and should avoid overlooking of the super-spreaders,so as not to cause social harm. When diagnosis and differential diagnosis are difficult,attention should be paid to opinions from the chest physicians.For patients who cannot rule out a potential history of exposure,i.e.,with related symptoms,imaging shows lung infection,white blood cells are not high,even if the nucleic acid test is negative,they should also be considered have 2019-nCoV pneumonia,or are suspected cases,should be recommended rapid isolation."	宋元林;白春学	391	复旦学报(医学版)	Fudan University Journal of Medical Sciences	2019-nCoV; pneumonia; outpatient; self-protection; clinical diagnosis; quality control; consensus;	http://new.oversea.cnki.net/kcms/detail/31.1885.r.20200212.1847.002.html	新型冠状病毒(2019-nCoV)肺炎流行期间呼吸科门诊质控上海专家共识	Shanghai expert consensus for respiratory clinic quality control during epidemic 2019-nCoV time

"ObjectiveTo study the epidemiological characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Zhoushan, so as to provide reference for improving the prevention and control capability of COVID-19. MethodsAll the confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Zhoushan, diagnosed according to China’s “COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment plan (fifth version) ” and reported from January 19 to February 17, 2020, were extracted from the infectious disease surveillance system. Data of general information, clinical characteristics, laboratory results, transmission and detection routes were collected and analyzed. ResultsBy February 17, Ten confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Zhoushan had been reported, including 7 males and 3 females. They were all adults, with an average age of (50.90±15.00) years. Five cases were discharged. The incubation period ranged from 2 to 12 days, with a median of 5 days. The first symptoms were fever (8 cases), cough (7 cases) and muscle pain (2 cases). Chest computed tomographic (CT) scans showed ground glass opacities in the lungs of all the cases. Six cases had Wuhan related exposure. SARS-CoV-2 was tested positive in the sputum specimens or throat swabs of all the cases and the faeces of 4 cases. The last suspicious exposure of 5 cases occurred before, and that of another 5 cases occurred after the onset of clinical symptoms in the confirmed maternal cases. Three cases were found in active consultation after clinical symptoms, and another 7 cases were found in the monitoring of close contacts. ConclusionsThe 10 confirmed cases of COVID-19 reported in Zhoushan are all adults, and most have Wuhan related exposure. SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in the fecal samples, but the existence of fecal-oral transmission needs more research. SARS-CoV-2 has strong infectivity, and may also have infectivity before the onset of symptoms (at the end of incubation period).

"Novel coronavirus pneumonia(NCP) is a new acute respiratory infectious disease, which is highly contagious and rapid progress. Large general hospitals play an important role in epidemic prevention and patient treatment. Department of Radiology is an important auxiliary for clinical diagnosis and treatment of NCP, and a key node in the whole epidemic prevention and control chain of the hospital. In Department of Radiology, in addition to special isolation room for NCP patient, there are many non-isolation rooms for outpatient running at the same time.

"Objective: To investigate the general features and distribution of Chinese medical syndrome of 2019-nCoV-infected pneumonia patients in Shanghai.Methods: Fifty 2019-nCoV-infected pneumonia patients from Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center were enrolled in this analysis. The epidemiological data, blood routine, chest CT, syndrome characteristics, tongue image and pulse information were collected on the first day of admission, and analyzed and differentiated according toChinese Medical Diagnosis and Treatment Plan for Shanghai 2019-nCoV-Infected Pneumonia(Trial).Results: The average age of 2019-nCoV-infected pneumonia patients was about 50 years old, most of them were male, the ratio of male to female was 1.27 ∶ 1, 74% of them had the history of visiting or living in Wuhan/Hubei, 20% of them had the history of close contact with the confirmed patients. The chest CT mainly showed multi lobed lesions, no abnormality in white blood cells was found, and the low level of lymphoid cells and high level of C-reactive protein were also identified. More than half of the patients showed fever(84%), cough(62%), fatigue(62%), poor appetite(58%), dry mouth(56%), diarrhea(56%) and spontaneous sweating(54%). The main tongue features were light red tongue or red tongue, with greasy coat(68%) and white coat(74%). The main Chinese medical syndrome was dampness-toxicity stagnation in lung( 82%), a small number of patients presented with syndrome of heat-toxicity blocking lung(18%). The average age of patients with syndrome of dampnesstoxicity stagnation in lung was significantly lower than that of patients with syndrome of heat-toxicity blocking lung(P = 0.002). The proportion of male patients with syndrome of dampness-toxicity stagnation in lung was obviously higher than that with syndrome of heattoxicity blocking lung(P = 0. 024).Conclusion: The main Chinese medical syndrome of 2019-nCoV-infected pneumonia patients is dampness-toxicity stagnation in lung, which is in line with characteristics of dampness epidemic in traditional Chinese medicine."	陆云飞;杨宗国;王梅;时佳;王振伟;吕莹;汤伯宗;叶晨;徐庆年;殷科珊;陈晓蓉	242	上海中医药大学学报	Academic Journal of Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine	2019-nCoV; pneumonia; Chinese medical syndrome; dampness-toxicity stagnation in lung; heat-toxicity blocking lung; dampness epidemic;	http://new.oversea.cnki.net/kcms/detail/31.1788.R.20200208.1112.002.html	50例新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎患者中医临床特征分析	Analysis on Chinese medical clinical characteristics of 50 patients with 2019-nCoV-infected pneumonia
"Novel coronavirus pneumonia(NCP) is a new outbreak infectious disease. There is no effective intervention for the severe patients, and their prognosis is poor. In the sixth edition ofNovel Coronavirus Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment Programissued by the State, the treatment on severe and critical cases is emphasized and the application of traditional Chinese medicine( TCM) therapy is specially mentioned. Relevant diagnosis and treatment programs and suggestions are also issued in many provinces, cities and autonomous regions, mostly referring to TCM prevention and treatment on severe cases. Through the analysis on the syndrome differentiation and treatment and medication rules of TCM in preventing and treating severe cases of NCP, which published in different versions ofNovel Coronavirus Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment Program, it is proposed that the treatment for severe and critical NCP cases should be performed under the guidance of Chinese medical theory, which focuses on the integration of TCM and modern western medicine,emphasizes the Chinese medical concept of “prevention of disease progress”, and takes advantage of TCM comprehensive treatment.

"In 2019,a human coronavirus has caused the pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan(a city of China).This virus was predicted as a new coronavirus,named the 2019 novel coronavirus(2019-nCoV),as it caused clinical symptoms different from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome(SARS)during the 2003outbreak.Currently,most of the researchers simply use the complete genome or specific structural gene sequences to investigate coronavirus(e.g.phylogenetic analysis)without considering the functions of the products from coronavirus genes.To overcome this shortcoming,we proposed the joint analysis of the molecular function and phylogeny,and applied it in our previous study of genomes of Betacoronavirus subgroup B(BB coronavirus).In that study,we identified a 22-bp complemented palindrome from a highly conserved Coding Sequence(CDS).Both the 22-bp complemented palindrome(named Nankai complemented palindrome)and the CDS(named Nankai CDS),evolutionary conserved in BB coronavirus genomes,were identified as genomic features associated to the molecular functions of BB coronavirus.In the present study,we used these two genomic features to trace the origin of 2019-nCoV(GenBank:MN908947)and conduct a preliminary study of the mechanisms in the cross-species infection and host adaption of BB coronavirus.Our analytical results show that 2019-nCoV with large differences from the SARS coronavirus,may originate from BB coronavirus in Chinese horseshoe bats(Rhinolophus sinicus).The most important finding is that the alternative translation of Nankai CDS can produce more than 17putative proteins,which may be responsible for the host adaption.The genotyping of 13 viruses using the17 putative proteins revealed the high mutation rate and diversity of BB coronavirus.Our study,for the first time,aimed to explain the reason for the high host adaptability of the multi-host BB coronavirus at the molecular level using large amounts of genomic data.The findings in the present study laid foundations for the rapid detection,genotyping,vaccine development and drug design of,but not limited to BB coronavirus."	陈嘉源;施劲松;丘栋安;刘畅;李鑫;赵强;阮吉寿;高山	185	生物信息学	Chinese Journal of Bioinformatics	Coronavirus; SARS; Alternative translation; 2019-nCoV; Cross-species infection;	http://new.oversea.cnki.net/kcms/detail/23.1513.Q.20200120.0839.002.html	2019新型冠状病毒基因组的生物信息学分析	Bioinformatics analysis of the 2019 novel coronavirus genome

As a classical theory of traditional Chinese medicine, ""exterior and interior relationship between Lung and Large Intestine"" coincides with the understanding of the relationship between intestinal microorganisms and respiratory diseases in modern medicine, and it has important guiding significance for lung diseases. Therefore, exploring the internal relationship between the theory of ""exterior and interior of lung and large intestine"" and COVID-19 and emphasizing the importance of maintaining intestinal microbial homeostasis to the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 is helpful to fully expand the ideas and methods of TCM in the treatment of COVID-19."	夏衍婧;黄艳辉	1037	中医药信息	Information on Traditional Chinese Medicine	N/A	http://new.oversea.cnki.net/kcms/detail/23.1194.R.20200224.1103.002.html	基于“肺与大肠相表里”浅谈新型冠状病毒肺炎（COVID-19）	A Brief Discussion on COVID-19 Based on the Theory of Exterior and Interior Relationship between Lung and Large Intestine

"Novel coronavirus pneumonia spreads rapidly and has a dangerous condition，which belongs to the category of plague of TCM. By reviewing the Yun-Qi analysis of SARS，we can find out the complexity and severity of the epidemic.According to the theory of ""climatic anomaly"" and ""the epidemic hiding three years""，combined with the actual clinical data，the outbreak and the disease location were speculated and verified as lung system. At the same time，according to the corresponding characteristics of five-Yun and six-Qi，the theory is further verified and revised by combining the actual climate change data of the National Meteorological Bureau，and the basic pathogenesis of the epidemic transmission is cold，heat and humidity cementation，and the accumulation of toxin leads to stasis and deficiency. According to this，we put forward the TCM diagnosis and treatment plan with the basic treatment methods of eliminating corruption with aromatic drugs，dissipating blood stasis and detoxicating，dredging lung Qi，lifting the spleen Qi and descending the stomach Qi so as to provide the theoretical and practical support for TCM to fight against epidemic diseases."	张维骏;刘润兰;张波	673	中华中医药学刊	Chinese Archives of Traditional Chinese Medicine	novel coronavirus pneumonia; five-Yun and six-Qi; Missing Chapters of Plain Questions; epidemic hiding three years;	http://new.oversea.cnki.net/kcms/detail/21.1546.R.20200220.0806.002.html	新型冠状病毒肺炎之五运六气解析	Five-Yun and Six-Qi Analysis for Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia
"It is concluded that novel coronavirus(2019-nCoV) pneumonia(NCP) belongs to the plague in TCM based on the clinical manifestations,combined with the analysis of the ""three states"" of time, space and human world as well as the ""three states"" of large ecology, small ecology and micro ecology. As the disease wind-cold-dampness and so it can be called wind-cold-dampness plague. According to BAI Changchuan’s guidance of the theory about exogenous febrile diseases, namely ""three classes of Zang-fu position, two changes of Qi-blood quality, four periods of deficiency and excessive conditions"", it can be divided into prodromal stage,progressive stage, critical stage and recovery stage. The therapeutic principle is to dispel pathogenic first. The basic pathogenesis of the prodromal stage is the spleen and lung attacked by wind-cold- dampness. It is advisable to strengthen the spleen and promote lung to dispel pathogenic factors. Modified Jianzhengqi Powder can be recommended. The pathogenesis of the progressive stage is heat and blocking of Qi movement, Xuanbai Chengqi Decoction and Shengjiang Powder could be recommended. The pathogenesis of the critical stage is the blocking of Qi movement and decline of Yang Qi. Different treatments of cold blocking and heat blocking are respectively to make Yang recover and open the orifices to induce resuscitation. Sini Jia Renshen Decoction could be recommended to treat cold blocking syndrome. For heat blocking syndrome，three classical formulae in Wenbing Tiaobian can be recommended. Based on the theories of five Yun and six Qi and latent Qi，it is easier to develop lung heat syndrome, so we should pay attention to the fixation of body fluid. The pathogenesis of the recovery stage is Qi deficiency and the treatment is mainly to strengthen the spleen and invigorate the lung as well as to nourish Yin.

"The 2019 novel Coronavirus(2019-nCoV) has caused the pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan(a city of China).In our previous study,the analytical results showed that both 2019-nCoV and SARS coronavirus belong to Betacoronavirus subgroup B(BB coronavirus),but have large differences,which are consistent with the differences in the clinical symptoms of two related diseases.The most important finding was that the alternative translation of Nankai CDS could produce more than 17 putative proteins,which may be responsible for the host adaption.The genotyping of 13 viruses using the 17 putative proteins revealed the high mutation rate and diversity of BB coronavirus.The present study for the first time(on January 21st,2020) reported a very important mutation in the Spike(S) proteins of Betacoronavirus.By this mutation,2019-nCoV acquired a cleavage site for furin enzyme in its S protein,which is not present in the S proteins of most other Betacoronavirus(e.g.SARS coronavirus).This cleavage site may increase the efficiency of virus infection into cells,making 2019-nCoV has significantly stronger transmissibility than SARS coronavirus.The infection mechanism of 2019-nCoV may be changed to being more similar to those of MHV,HIV,Ebola virus(EBoV) and some avian influenza viruses,other than those of most other Betacoronavirus(e.g.SARS coronavirus).In addition,we unexpectedly found that some avian influenza viruses acquired a cleavage site for furin enzyme by the similar mutation as 2019-nCoV.Therefore,the natural mutation can result in a short insertion to form a cleavage site for furin enzyme.The cleavage site for furin enzyme in2019-nCoV contains the ""CGGCGG"" sequence encoding two arginine(R) residues. ""CGG"",however is a rare codon for human.So we concluded that these two codons were present in the2019-nCoV-like Betacoronavirus before they transmitted into human and the intermediate host(s)are mammals with a high relative frequency of ""CGG"" usage.We provide a relative frequency table of ""CGG"" usage in mammals to help identify the intermediate hosts of 2019-nCoV.Future studies of this mutation will help to reveal the stronger transmissibility of 2019-nCoV and lay foundations for vaccine development and drug design of,but not limited to 2019-nCoV."	李鑫;段广有;张伟;施劲松;陈嘉源;陈舜梅;高山;阮吉寿	978	生物信息学	Chinese Journal of Bioinformatics	N/A	http://new.oversea.cnki.net/kcms/detail/23.1513.Q.20200224.1809.002.html	2019新型冠状病毒S蛋白可能存在Furin蛋白酶切位点	A furin cleavage site was discovered in the S protein of the 2019 novel coronavirus

"To discuss the etiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment of novel coronavirus pneumonia based on the theory of febrile diseases. The theory of febrile diseases, derived from the accumulation of TCM classical theories and developed through the practice of plague prevention and treatment, has a systematic discussion on the etiology, pathogenesis, pattern identification and treatment of exogenous febrile diseases including virulent ones. It also has played an active role in the prevention and treatment of novel infectious diseases in China in recent years. “Warm-febrile diseases” and“plague” are interlinked. Plagues are mainly caused by heat toxin and epidemic pathogens, manifested as heat pattern and yang pattern, and can be treated according to the disease stages differentiated by “Wei-Qi-Ying-Xue or “Sanjiao” pattern identification methods, or treated with the prescriptions from famous ancient doctors such as Wu Youke and Pang Anshi, etc. These theories related to causes, mechanism, patterns and treatment may be helpful for the TCM diagnosis and treatment of novel coronavirus pneumonia. In addition, the lungs and large intestine form an exterior and interior relationship, and the gastrointestinal tract is also the place where novel coronavirus invades or proliferates, it may be a way to reduce virus infection and lung inflammation in the body by adopting the TCM method of clearing heat and dredging the lower part to give pathogenic factors a way out from the bowels."	刘成海;王宇	467	上海中医药杂志	Shanghai Journal of Traditional Chinese Medicine	novel coronavirus pneumonia; theory of febrile diseases; heat toxin and epidemic pathogens; expelling pathogens to the exterior with pungent-cold herbs; clearing heat and dredging the lower part; give pathogenic factors a way out; Dayuan decoction;	http://new.oversea.cnki.net/kcms/detail/31.1276.r.20200216.1357.001.html	温病学理论指导下的新型冠状病毒肺炎诊治刍议	Discussion on the application of febrile disease theory to the diagnosis and treatment of novel coronavirus pneumonia

"Since December 2019, a new coronavirus-infected pneumonia was first detected in Wuhan, such cases had been subsequently discovered in other cities. China’s National Health Commission and other provinces and cities have successively performed syndrome differentiation of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and provided corresponding Chinese medicine treatment programs. In this epidemic, the disease is a “dampness toxin”. The best principle for treatment is early detection and early treatment. Both Chinese and Western medicine have their own advantages. The advantages could be complementary and could not be replaced. Therefore, we collected the Chinese medicine treatment programs for the treatment of new coronavirus pneumonia comprehensively and conduct a systematic analysis, especially analyzed the pharmacological basis of traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of new coronavirus pneumonia, which provided a basis for the rationality of Chinese medicine prescription for the treatment of new coronary virus pneumonia, and provide a reference of updating the diagnosis and treatment plan for provinces and cities."	任伟钰;苏敬;刘永琦;侯雯倩;郑宜];魏本君;靳晓杰;张利英;张志明;刘东玲;宁艳梅	966	中草药	Chinese Traditional and Herbal Drugs	severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; coronavirus disease 2019; traditional Chinese medicine; diagnosis and treatment scheme; medication regimen;	http://new.oversea.cnki.net/kcms/detail/12.1108.R.20200225.1153.004.html	全国各省区中医药治疗新型冠状病毒肺炎（COVID-19）的诊疗方案分析	Analysis on diagnosis and treatment scheme of traditional Chinese medicine in treatment of COVID-19 in Chinese provinces and regions
"The coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19), originated in Wuhan city, Hubei Province, China in December 2019, and then quickly spread to most provinces and regions in China and even spread to many countries abroad. COVID-19 is characterized by wide epidemic, strong infectivity, rapid onset and critical condition. In the face of this epidemic, all parts of the country quickly set off a peak in the fight against COVID-19, but no effective drug for COVID-19 has been developed in the short term. Recently, many hospitals have combined traditional Chinese medicine with western medicine in treatment, and the clinical effect is remarkable, which proves the antiviral effect of traditional Chinese medicine. A large number of pharmacological and clinical studies have proved that the Chinese materia medica S. flavescens has significant antiviral effect. In this paper, the mechanism of anti-coronavirus effect of S. flavescens is expounded from multiple pathways, such as type Ⅰ interferon, NF-κB signal pathway, ERK signal pathway, PI3K/Akt signal pathway and matrine alkaloids, etc. It is intended to provide reference for clinical treatment of coronavirus infection pneumonia and research and development of related drugs of S. flavescens."	李振;俞科贤	964	中草药	Chinese Traditional and Herbal Drugs	Sophora flavescens Ait.; coronavirus; coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); SARS-CoV-2; mechanism; type Ⅰ interferon; NF-κB signal pathway; ERK signal pathway; PI3K/Akt signal pathway;	http://new.oversea.cnki.net/kcms/detail/12.1108.R.20200225.0852.002.html	苦参多路径抗冠状病毒的机制探究	Exploration on mechanism of anti-coronavirus of Sophora flavescens through multi-pathway

"The outbreak of COVID-19 coronavirus pneumonia in December 2019 has aroused great concern worldwide. At present, the COVID-19 coronavirus pneumonia is highly contagious, rapid and widespread. It has been reported that COVID-19 virus is spread by respiratory droplets, digestive tract, and direct contact transmission, and it has various clinical manifestations. Some patients do not even appear obvious fever and have negative results for throat swab virus culture, which bring difficulties to scientific diagnosis and treatment. At present, western medicine treats most patients with anti-viral drugs, hormones and other drugs, or treats critically ill patients with ECMO oxygenation, important organ function support and other emergency treatments. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) based on syndrome differentiation and treatment has obtained curative effects in this outbreak. In order to improve the effects and safety of Chinese and western drug therapy, we applied literature-mining method and network pharmacology, summarized the potential liver injury during the application of western medicine and discussed hepatotoxicity networks and potential pathway targets of ingredients in Chinese patent medicine and Chinese herbal compound.

"At present, the 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is rampant all over the country, and controlling the spread of it’s epidemic has become a top priority. It is very difficult to control the epidemic spreading because there is no specific drug to fight against it. Therefore, It is urgent task for us how to develop a specific drug as soon as possible, and attracting worldwide attention. The studies on anti-2019-nCoV drugs generally were carried out in three modes, as vaccine, chemistry and traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Because the developing on vaccines and chemicals takes too long, it is hard to solve the urgent problem, What’s more, the RNA of coronavirus has been recombined with so quick that the vaccines and drugs that have been studied with great efforts not only miss the epidemic time, but also can’t be used next time, as a result that the work of epidemic prevention is formidable. However, the prescriptions from traditional Chinese medicine theory can cure the epidemic disease, but how to develop it into a specific drug with clear chemical composition and clear pharmacologic mechanism, is also an urgent problem to be solved. In this paper, the new coronavirus and its drug development are reviewed, while the advantages and disadvantages are analyzed, and the drug dilemma research phenomenon is clarified by using the supramolecular “qi chromatography” theory. It is suggested that the strategy of anti-coronavirus drug developing should be put forward on base of the impact of biological supramolecular “imprinting template” and “qi chromatography”, in order to develop new drugs against 2019-nCoV and to control the spread of the epidemic as quick as we can, and to be established a new research and development model of anti-coronavirus drug on integration of traditional Chinese and Western medicine, turning passive into active."	贺福元;邓凯文;潘雪;周逸群	146	中草药	Chinese Traditional and Herbal Drugs	2019-novel coronavirus(2019-nCoV); epidemic situation; traditional Chinese medicine theory; supermolecule; qi chromatography; imprinted template; modernization of traditional Chinese medicine;	http://new.oversea.cnki.net/kcms/detail/12.1108.R.20200206.1442.002.html	基于中医药超分子“气析”理论探讨抗新型冠状病毒药物的研究策略	Research strategy of 2019-novel coronavirus drugs based on supramolecular “qi chromatography” theory of TCM

"Objective To collect main ingredients and targets of Qing-Fei-Pai-Du-Tang(QFPDT), to investigate the relationship between the targets and novel coronavirus pneumonia(COVID-19) and the multi-component, multi-target mechanism of QFPDT for the treatment of COVID-19. Methods The meridian tropisms, compounds and targets of each herb in QFPDT were collected from ETCM, TCMID and NPASS database. Cytoscape software was used to construct and analysis networks. DAVID and STRING were applied for functional enrichment analysis of targets. Results The top meridian tropismof herbs in QFPDT is lung meridian. Among QFPDT’s 790 putative targets, 232 are co-expressed with ACE2, the receptor of novel coronavirus(SARS-CoV-2). The targets include 7 densely interacting ribosomal proteins. Important targets are enriched on two classes of disease pathways, i.e., virus infection and lung injury. In addition, many targets interact with 6 proteins of HIV virus. Important targets regulate a series of pathways belong to translation, endocrine system, immune system, nervous system and signal transduction. Conclusion QFPDT’s chief targeting organ is the lung and the second is the spleen. By regulating a series of proteins co-expressed with ACE2 and a series of signaling pathways closely related to the occurrence and development of diseases, it plays a role in balancing immunityand eliminating inflammation.

"Based on the report of epidemic data sets for Hubei province and mainland China, the big data from Baidu population migration trends and distributions, we formulated the COVID-19 transmission model on complex networks for Wuhan city and the 15 surrounding cities with severe epidemics, and analyzed the possible times for resumption of work in Wuhan and its surrounding areas and the impact of resumption of work on the risk of a secondary outbreak. Firstly, we estimated the actual cumulative number of cases in Wuhan on January 23 rd on the basis of the cumulative number of reported cases in other 15 cities, and obtained the control reproduction numbers for the 16 major cities in Hubei province in different periods. Our research results revealed that the early transmission risk in these areas is high and the current transmission risk is low(due to the control reproduction numbers being less than 1). By simulating the whole network model on the flow network structure and flow volume in the same period of last year, we investigated the impact of the resumption of work on February 17,February 24 and March 2 on disease infection for each city. Main conclusion showed that under strong prevention measures and self-protection the second outbreak will not be caused during a period by the resumption of work on March 2, 2020."	王霞;唐三一;陈勇;冯晓梅;肖燕妮;徐宗本	1046	中国科学:数学	Scientia Sinica Mathematica	novel coronavirus pneumonia; network modelling; controlling reproduction number; epidemic prediction;	http://new.oversea.cnki.net/kcms/detail/11.5836.o1.20200220.1907.002.html	新型冠状病毒肺炎疫情下武汉及周边地区何时复工?数据驱动的网络模型分析	When will be the resumption of work in Wuhan and its surrounding areas during COVID-19 epidemic?

"Initially reported “cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown etiology” were associated with exposure with Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan in December, 2019. Chinese scholars rapidly identified that it was a new coronavirus which caused the pneumonia cases. The virus was thoroughly sequenced and on January 7, 2020, Chinese researchers shared the full genetic sequence of 2019-nCoV through the National Institutes of Health GenBank database and the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data(GISAID). Soon later, the virus was named as 2019-nCoV by WHO.

"Since late December 2019, an outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus diseases(COVID-19) in Wuhan, China has spread quickly nationwide. With the spread of COVID-19, the routine clinical diagnosis and treatment for lung cancer patients has been disturbed. Due to the systemic immunosuppressive of lung cancer patients caused by the malignancy and anticancer treatments, lung cancer patients are more susceptible to infection than healthy individuals. Furthermore, patients with cancer had poorer prognosis from infection. Lung cancer patients should be the priority group for COVID-19 prevention. The protection provisions and control measures aiming to protect lung cancer patients from COVID-19 have been increasingly concerned. During the COVID-19 outbreak period, it should be carefully differentiated for fever and respiratory symptoms for lung cancer patients receiving anti-tumor treatment, in order to evaluate the risk of COVID-19. Moreover, it is necessary to carry out meticulous and individualized clinical management for lung cancer patients to effectively protect the patients from COVID-19."	徐燕;刘洪生;胡克;王孟昭	1020	中国肺癌杂志	Chinese Journal of Lung Cancer	Lung neoplasms; Patient management; 2019 novel coronavirus disease;	http://new.oversea.cnki.net/kcms/detail/12.1395.R.20200223.0929.002.html	新型冠状病毒肺炎疫情期间肺癌患者临床管理	Clinical Management of Lung Cancer Patients during the Outbreak of 2019 Novel Coronavirus Disease(COVID-19)

"Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) practitioners have deepened their understanding of the disease theory with the gradually increasing degree of clinical intervention of novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP). Especially, “Dampness Toxin” has reached consensus as the core of TCM pathogenesis. However, the pathogenesis and transmission laws of NCP still need to be quickly improved to promote optimization to form a more effective common regimen for diagnosis and treatment of TCM on NCP. The author’s team based on first-line clinical and academic data verified the cause and proposed that “cold-dampness and retained fluid blocking lung with fire deficiency of Mingmen” be important pathogenesis for severe patients with NCP.

"In this paper, the author systematically summarized and explained the idea of Prof. Jiang Liang-duo for preventing and treating the Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (NCP). According to Prof. Jiang, in the early stage of the disease, dampness and heat injury to the lung is the main cause and pathogenesis, and the high-risk group can be protected by supplementing Qi and nourishing Yin, clearing away heat and penetration. The patients with mild disease can be treated with Chinese medicine. But the accurately treatment can be given only knowing the ratio of the dampness, heat, deficiency and excess. For the patients with severe disease, both strengthening and removing pathogenic factors are important. But the drug for Qi should be prescribed instead of drugs for blood. The prognosis of critical illed patients is very poor, and the method of Invigorating Qi and taking Jin is useful to strengthen the foundation, promot lung, remove dampness, clear heat and cool Ying. Clinical medication should be adjusted according to people, time and place in the different situations."	杨华升;王兰;姜良铎	637	中国实验方剂学杂志	Chinese Journal of Experimental Traditional Medical Formulae	Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia; Etiology and pathogenesis; Lung damage from hot and humidity; Qi cannot immobilize body fluid;	http://new.oversea.cnki.net/kcms/detail/11.3495.R.20200218.1550.004.html	姜良铎教授防治新型冠状病毒肺炎遣方用药思路	Professor Jiang Liangduo’s Experience and Thought on Treatment of Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia

"To investigate the regularity of prescription and clinical syndromes by analyzing the diagnosis and treatment protocols of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) for novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP), so as to provide references for syndrome differentiation and relevant researches. The diagnosis and treatment protocols of NCP published by national and regional health authorities were searched, and information was extracted in regard to disease stages, type of syndromes, and prescriptions, etc. Frequency statistics and relative analysis were used to analyze the rule of syndrome differentiation and prescription with TCM, and further discussion on the pathogenesis and progress of the disease. A total of 26 diagnosis and treatment protocols of TCM for NCP were retrieved after screening (including one national scheme and 25 regional ones), among which 16 contained aspects of both prevention and treatment, 7 only involved treatment contents and 3 were prevention schemes. The courses of NCP can be divided into early stage, middle stage, severe stage and recovery stage. The pathogeny of NCP in TCM is damp-toxin, with the core pathogenesis of damp-toxin retention in lung and Qi repression. Its pathological features can be summarized as ?damp, toxin, obstruction, deficiency″. The location of the disease is lung, always involving spleen and stomach, and may further affect heart and kidney in severe cases. The major treatments for each course are Fanghua Shizuo, Xuanfei Touxie (early stage); Qingre Jiedu, Xuanxie Feire (middle stage); Kaibi Gutuo, Huiyang Jiuni (severe stage); Qingjie Yure, Yiqi Yangyin (recovery stage). There were many diagnosis and treatment protocols for NCP have been published, which generally followed the national edition, through with certain personalities in different regional protocols. There were common features with respect to the disease stage, syndrome differentiation, therapeutic principles and methods, as well as prescriptions; the treatment were generally carried out against the core pathogenesis and progress of the disease. Along with the deepening recognition of NCP, the diagnosis and treatment protocols are still need further concretization and standardization. We hope researchers and decision-makers can pay more attention to the treatment of Huayu Tongluo in severe and recovery period."	庞稳泰;金鑫瑶;庞博;杨丰文;王辉;刘春香;郑文科;张俊华	690	中国中药杂志	China Journal of Chinese Materia Medica	novel coronavirus pneumonia; 2019-nCoV; pneumonia; traditional Chinese medicine; pattern of prescriptions and syndromes;	http://new.oversea.cnki.net/kcms/detail/11.2272.r.20200218.1849.003.html	中医药防治新型冠状病毒肺炎方证规律分析	Analysis on pattern of prescriptions and syndromes of traditional Chinese medicine for prevention and treatment of novel coronavirus pneumonia
"The outbreak caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is still spreading, posing a great threat to the safety and health of general population. However, there have not been any effective drugs for treatment, with symptomatic treatment and prevention prevailing. The treatment plans of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) are often used for reference in clinic. The advantages of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) in treating SARS and MERS are that it can intervene and block the progression of disease in early stage, significantly reduce symptoms, shorten the treatment duration of patients, reduce complications and side effects caused by hormone therapy. The novel coronavirus pneumonia belongs to the category of TCM epidemic diseases. Chinese patent medicines and prescriptions in medical observation and clinical treatment were recommended in the ""pneumonia diagnosis and treatment plan for new coronavirus infection"" (trial version fifth) of the National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China. Qingfei Paidu Decotion was recommended for the treatment of new coronavirus pneumonia by the National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China and National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine. TCM shows good clinical efficacy and great potential in the treatment of new coronavirus pneumonia. Previous studies of TCM have shown broad-spectrum antiviral activity, providing a variety of sources for the discovery of new antiviral drugs. In this paper, we reviewed traditional Chinese medicines and its active ingredients in the hope of bringing novel inspirations to the drug screening and clinical treatment for new coronavirus pneumonia."	张宇实;丛伟红;张晶晶;郭非非;李洪梅	686	中国中药杂志	China Journal of Chinese Materia Medica	Chinese herbal medicine; human coronavirus; COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2(2019-nCoV); severe acute respiratory syndrome; middle East respiratory syndrome; intervention effect;	http://new.oversea.cnki.net/kcms/detail/11.2272.R.20200219.1817.001.html	中草药及其活性成分对人冠状病毒干预作用的研究进展	Research progress of intervention of Chinese herbal medicine and its active components on human coronavirus
"Since the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, the epidemic has developed rapidly and the situation is grim. LANCET figured out that the SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to ""cytokine storm"". ""Cytokine storm"" is an excessive immune response of the body to external stimuli such as viruses and bacteria. As the virus attacking the body, it stimulates the secretion of a large number of inflammatory factors: interleukin (IL), interferon (IFN), C-X-C motif chemokine (CXCL) and so on, which lead to cytokine cascade reaction. With the exudation of inflammatory factors, cytokines increase abnormally in tissues and organs, interfering with the immune system, causing excessive immune response of the body, resulting in diffuse damage of lung cells, pulmonary fibrosis, and multiple organ damage, even death. Arachidonic acid (AA) metabolic pathway is principally used to synthesize inflammatory cytokines, such as monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), IL, IFN, etc., which is closely related to the occurrence, development and regression of inflammation. Therefore, the inhibition of AA metabolism pathway is benefit for inhibiting the release of inflammatory factors in the body and alleviating the ""cytokine storm"". Based on the pharmacophore models of the targets on AA metabolic pathway, the traditional Chinese medicine database 2009 (TCMD 2009) was screened. The potential herbs were ranked by the number of hit molecules, which were scored by pharmacophore fit value. In the end, we obtained the potential active prescriptions on “cytokine storm” according to the potential herbs in the “National novel coronavirus pneumonia diagnosis and treatment plan (trial version sixth)”. The results showed that the hit components with the inhibitory effect on AA were magnolignan Ⅰ, lonicerin and physcion-8-O-β-D-glucopyranoside, which mostly extracted from Magnoliae Officinalis Cortex, Zingiberis Rhizoma Recens, Lonicerae Japonicae Flos, Rhei Radix et Rhizoma, Salviae Miltiorrhizae Radix et Rhizoma, Scutellariae Radix, Gardeniae Fructus, Ginseng Radix et Rhizoma, Arctii Fructus, Dryopteridis Crassirhizomatis Rhizoma, Paeoniaeradix Rubra, Dioscoreae Rhizoma. Finally the anti-SARS-CoV-2 prescriptions were analyzed to obtain the potential active prescriptions on AA metabolic pathway, Huoxiang zhengqi Capsules, Jinhua Qinggan Granules, Lianhua Qingwen Capsules, Qingfei Paidu Decoction, Xuebijing Injection, Reduning Injection and Tanreqing Injection were found that may prevent SARS-CoV-2 via regulate cytokines. This study intends to provide reference for clinical use of traditional Chinese medicine to resist new coronavirus."	任越;姚美村;霍晓乾;谷宇;朱卫星;乔延江;张燕玲	960	中国中药杂志	China Journal of Chinese Materia Medica	"SARS-CoV-2; ""cytokine storm""; arachidonic acid metabolic pathway; virtual screening; traditional Chinese medicine;"	http://new.oversea.cnki.net/kcms/detail/11.2272.R.20200225.1522.006.html	抗新型冠状病毒方剂基于花生四烯酸代谢通路防治“细胞因子风暴”的研究	Study on treatment of “cytokine storm” by anti-SARS-CoV-2 prescriptions based on arachidonic acid metabolic pathway
"The outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) seriously endangers people’s health. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been recommended for the treatment of NCP by Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Prevention and Control Strategy, which have made outstanding contributions to the prevention and control of the epidemic. The wide application ofChinese medicine asked the pharmacists and doctors, nurses, and medical technicians in Wuhan and around the country to stand on the front line of NCP treatment and provide pharmaceutical care services, which has effectively guaranteed the safety and rational use of Chinese medicine. This article will introduce the TCM cognition of the NCP, analyze the clinical application of Chinese medicine and the entry point of pharmaceutical care, and clarify that clinical Chinese pharmacists can participate in making medication therapy plan, medication reconciliation, and prescription review, pharmaceutical monitoring, promoting rational drug use, and drug risk management. The participation of clinical Chinese pharmacists in the prevention and treatment of NCP is conducive to improving the level of rational use of TCM, by ensuring the effectiveness, and safety."	林志健;张冰	333	中国中药杂志	China Journal of Chinese Materia Medica	novel coronavirus pneumonia; traditional Chinese medicine; clinical Chinese pharmacist; pharmaceutical care; medication mornitoring;	http://new.oversea.cnki.net/kcms/detail/11.2272.R.20200212.1028.004.html	临床中药药师参与新型冠状病毒肺炎（NCP）防治的药学服务策略	Strategy of pharmaceutical care services for clinical Chinese pharmacists in novel coronavirus pneumonia
"Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has a severe and complicated epidemic situation, and it is of great significance to discuss the rules and characteristics of the prescription of COVID-19 in traditional Chinese medicine. This study collected the traditional Chinese medicine prevention and treatment of COVID-19 from the National Health Committee of China, 7 provinces and municipal health committees, the Chinese Medicine Administration and published in the ""Handbook of Traditional Chinese Medicine Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19"" from January 1 to February 18, 2020, and prepared by 3 masters of Chinese medicine and 4 well-known Chinese medicine experts. Those were selected according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, and EpiData 3.0 software was used to establish the ""Traditional Chinese Medicine Prescription Library for the Prevention and Treatment of COVID-19"" and the ""Common Database of Traditional Chinese Medicine for the Prevention and Treatment of COVID-19"". A total of 93 effective Chinese medicine prescriptions and a total of 157 kinds of constituent medicines were collected. Data analysis was performed by SPSS 18.0 software. The results showed that: ①most of the medicines with cold and warm properties, 69 cold medicines, accounting for 43.95%, 57 warm medicines, accounting for 36.31%, and less hot medicines, only 1.27%; ②there are many pungent, bitter and sweet medicines, and the distribution of medicinal flavors is different in different periods. The pungent medicines are mostly in the early stage, the bitter drugs are the main part in the middle and severe periods, and the sweet medicines are mostly used in the recovery period; ③the meridian of the drug is more into the lung, stomach, and heart, and most of drugs are into the lung meridian, accounting for 24.55%; it is mostly into the lungs and stomach in the first and middle stages, and into the heart and kidney in severe stages; ④Oral drugs are mostly non-toxic, only 6 kinds of drugs are toxic, namely Armeniacae Semen Amarum, Dryopteridis Crassirhizomatis Rhizoma, Paridis Rhizoma, Pinelliae Rhizoma, Aconiti Lateralis Radix Praeparaia; ⑤Most of the drugs have five types of functions: treating exterior syndromes, resolving dampness, clearing heat, replenishing deficiency, resolving phlegm, cough, and asthma. In the early stage, both drugs for treating exterior syndromes and heat clearing drugs were equal, accounting for 18.81% each. In the medium periods, more resolving phlegm, cough, and asthma drugs are used, accounting for 29.61%. In the severe periods, heat clearing drugs are used the most, accounting for 33.33%. During the recovery period, tonic deficiency drugs are used the most, accounting for 36.47%. The medicinal characteristics and efficacy distribution of COVID-19 prevention and treatment by Chinese medicine are closely related to the Chinese medicine’s understanding of its etiology, disease location and pathogenesis. The identification and treatment of COVID-19 clinical syndromes need to pay attention to staged medication and local conditions."	古敏;刘娇;史楠楠;李晓东;黄正德;吴剑坤;王玉光;王燕平;翟华强;王永炎	959	中国中药杂志	China Journal of Chinese Materia Medica	corona virus disease 2019; prevention and treatment of traditional Chinese medicine; characteristics of medicinal properties; efficacy distribution;	http://new.oversea.cnki.net/kcms/detail/11.2272.R.20200225.1529.007.html	中医药分期防治新型冠状病毒肺炎的药性功效分析	Analysis of property and efficacy of traditional Chinese medicine in staging prevention and treatment of corona virus disease 2019
"In December,2019, an outbreak of respiratory disease named as COVID-19,caused by SARS-COV-2,emgerged in Wuhan, China. Unfortunately, it reached mulitiple continents in past two months, With a very high transmission rate and a mortality rate for about 2.1%.The homology of SARS-COV-2 and SARS-COV reached more than 85%, and both of them would infect the epithelial cells of host by interacting with ACE2 protein molecule on the surface of host cells .The Analysis of the characteristics of patients with COVID-19 infection and the pathologic anatomy of the first case of death suggest that acute respiratory distress syndrome plays an important role in the course of disease in patients with COVID-19 infection. Ambroxol, as a common expectorant drug for respiratory system, also has a good clinical effect in the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome and pulmonary fibrosis. Ambroxol has also been recently found to be an ACE2 binding agent, which is expected to play a unique role in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19."	李敏;王进	1041	中国临床药理学杂志	The Chinese Journal of Clinical Pharmacology	N/A	http://new.oversea.cnki.net/kcms/detail/11.2220.R.20200223.2334.002.html	氨溴索治疗2019新型冠状病毒肺炎展望	Prospect of ambroxol in the treatment of COVID-2019
"The novel coronavirus epidemic is raging in China and more than 20 other countries and regions since the middle of December 2019. Currently, there is no specific drug or vaccine besides symptomatic supportive therapy. Taking full advantage of the clinical experience of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) in preventing and controlling major epidemics such as SARS, it is an important mission for TCM to propose effective formula with immediate response and solid evidence by using modern biomedical knowledge and techniques (molecular docking assisted TCM formulation for short). In view of the high homology between the gene sequences of the novel coronavirus and SARS virus, and the similarities between the two in terms of pathogenic mechanism and clinical manifestations, our team established a rapid screening and optimization model for the prevention and treatment of the novel coronavirus based on clinical experience and molecular docking technology. Firstly, the clinical team and the research team pre-developed and screened TCM formula by using ""back-to-back"" manner. Then, the formula was optimized and determined by comparing and analyzing the results of the two groups. The results showed that the research team screened out 46 active ingredients from candidate TCMs that could act on the novel coronavirus S-protein-binding site of human ACE2 protein, which were mainly attributed to 7 herbs such as Lonicerae Japonicae Flos and Mori Folium. The result was largely consistent with the formula raised by the clinical group, verifying and supporting its rationality. This provides evidence for the scientific and potential efficacy of the TCM prescription from the perspective of treatment target analysis, and also suggests that the TCM prescription has the potential to directly inhibit viral infection in addition to improving clinical symptoms or syndromes. Based on this, our team optimized and formed a new anti-coronavirus TCM prescription ""Keguan Yihao"", immediately providing the TCM prescription with certain clinical experience and objective evidence support for the prevention and treatment of new emergent infectious diseases in our hospital. The TCM prescription was combined with modern medicine symptomatic supportive treatment for clinical treatment, preliminary results showed better effect than symptomatic supportive therapy alone. This research has innovated the method mode in clinical practice and basic research integration of traditional Chinese medicine for the prevention and control of new emerging infectious diseases. It is of great significance to further improve the rapid response mechanism of TCM in face of major epidemics, and further improve the capability level of TCM to prevent and treat new emerging infectious diseases."	牛明;王睿林;王仲霞;张萍;柏兆方;景婧;郭玉明;赵旭;湛小燕;张子腾;宋雪艾;秦恩强;王伽伯;肖小河	189	基于临床经验和分子对接技术的抗新型冠状病毒中医组方快速筛选模式及应用	China Journal of Chinese Materia Medica	N/A	http://new.oversea.cnki.net/kcms/detail/11.2272.R.20200207.1317.001.html	N/A	N/A

"An ongoing outbreak of a novel coronavirus infection in Wuhan, China since December 2019 has led to 31,516 infected persons and 638 deaths across 25 countries (till 16:00 on February 7, 2020). The virus causing this pneumonia was then named as the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) by the World Health Organization. To promote the data sharing and make all relevant information of 2019-nCoV publicly available, we construct the 2019 Novel Coronavirus Resource (2019nCoVR, https://bigd.big.ac.cn/ncov). 2019nCoVR features comprehensive integration of genomic and proteomic sequences as well as their metadata information from the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data, National Center for Biotechnology Information, China National GeneBank, National Microbiology Data Center and China National Center for Bioinformation (CNCB) / National Genomics Data Center (NGDC). It also incorporates a wide range of relevant information including scientific literatures, news, and popular articles for science dissemination, and provides visualization functionalities for genome variation analysis results based on all collected 2019-nCoV strains.

"Objective To observe clinical presentations and CT features of imported corona virus disease 2019(COVID-19).Methods Clinical and CT data of 12 patients with imported COVID-19 were retrospectively analyzed.Results All 12 patients had epidemiological history.The most common symptoms were fever(n=12)and cough(n=8).Nine patients had normal white blood cell counts,7 patients had decreased lymphocyte counts and 5 had elevated C-reactive protein.The lesions involved both lungs in 10 cases,while involved single lung in 2 cases,limited to 1 lobe in 2 cases,2 lobes in 3 cases,3 lobes in 2 cases,while involved both whole lungs in 5 cases.The lesions were mainly distributed in the peripheral zone under the pleura in all 12 cases,presented as pure ground-glass nodules(GGO)in 2 cases,GGO with solid components in 6 cases,GGO with solid nodules in 4 cases.The morphology of lesions included patch shadow in 10 cases and circular shape in 2 cases.Air bronchus signs were observed in 6 cases,thickened leaflet septa were found in 4 cases and fibrous foci were noticed in 3 cases.Neither pleural effusion nor lymphadenopathy was seen in any of these 12 patients.Conclusion Most COVID-19 patients have epidemiology histories.The main symptoms of COVID-19 patients are fever and cough,whose laboratory tests showing normal white blood cell counts and reduced granulocyte counts,while CT depicting multiple peripheral GGO lesions of the lungs."	李小虎;潘红利;束晶苇;钱银锋;吴兴旺;王海宝;李晓舒;束宏敏;李仁民;刘咸英;王玉萍;刘斌;余永强	1017	中国医学影像技术	Chinese Journal of Medical Imaging Technology	"novel coronavirus; pneumonia,viral; tomography,X-ray computed;"	http://new.oversea.cnki.net/kcms/detail/11.1881.R.20200223.1824.001.html	输入性新型冠状病毒肺炎临床和CT特征	Clinical presentations and CT features of imported corona virus disease 2019
"Human coronavirus(HCoV)is one of the important pathogens of human respiratory tract infection. In order to clarify the genetic characteristics of HCoV-OC43 in severe acute respiratory infection(SARI)cases at the molecular level,a total of 374 samples obtained from SARI cases in Henan Province,China,in 2019 were screened for the nucleic acids of HCoV-OC43 by real - time polymerase chain reaction(PCR). Reverse transcription-PCR amplification and sequencing of spike(S),RNA-dependent RNA polymerase(RdRp)and nucleocapsid(N)was carried out in samples with positive detection of the nucleic acids of HCoV-OC43. Upon combination of 42 representative sequences obtained from the GenBank database,phylogenetic trees were constructed based on three full-length sequences of S,RdRp and N genes. The HCoV-OC43 strains obtained from SARI cases were genotyped and the genetic characteristics of three target genes were analyzed. Variations in the amino acids of S protein(an important antigen of HCoV-OC43)were also analyzed. Results showed that15(4.01%)out of 374 samples from SARI cases were positive for HCoV-OC43,and the full-length sequences of S,RdRp and N genes were obtained from 4 out of 15 samples. Based on the phylogenetic trees of these three target genes,three strains belonged to the G genotype and one strain belonged to the H genotype. Analysis of the amino - acid variations of S protein indicated that there were three special sites of amino - acid variation(L272P,P516S and S902A)among the G genotype strains in 2019,including the three strains in our study and USA/MN306041/SC0810/2019. Another special variation in amino acids(N484D)was found among the H genotype strains in 2019,including one strain in our study and USA/MN306043/SC0841/2019. Based on the genotype identification and genetic characteristics of HCoV-OC43 strains from SARI cases in Henan Province,in 2019,baseline data for the study of molecular epidemiology of HCoV-OC43 in China have been provided."	孙凯旋;崔爱利;何佩;许文波;张荣波	952	病毒学报	Chinese Journal of Virology	Human coronavirus OC43(HCoV-OC43); Genotyping; Genetic characteristics;	http://new.oversea.cnki.net/kcms/detail/11.1865.R.20200225.1022.002.html	严重急性呼吸道感染病例中人冠状病毒OC43基因特征分析	The Genetic Characteristics of Human Coronavirus OC43 in Cases of Severe A cute Respiratory Infection
"Coronavirus(CoV)has a wide range of hosts which infect humans across host barriers and even cause human-to-human transmission. In December 2019,a novel coronavirus(2019 novel coronavirus,2019-nCoV)emerged the pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan,China,causing worldwide concern. As of 10 February 2020,there were 40,235 lab-confirmed cases in China,909 deaths with a 2.3% mortality rate;6,484 severe cases with a 16.1% rate. Meanwhile,lab-confirmed cases were reported in 25 countries/regions worldwide. Up to date,the 2019-nCoV has become the third CoV that can cause fatal disease in humans after the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus(SARS-CoV)in Mainland China and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus(MERS-CoV)in Saudi Arabia,the Middle East. Our scientists are expected to study and explore a series of questions for the 2019-nCoV outbreak including animal source of virus,intermediate hosts,transmission routes,pathogenesis,prevention and control etc. To understand the research tools of the new pathogen and learn from research experience of SARS-and MERS-CoV for developing attenuated vaccine strains,screening drugs and studying pathogenic mechanisms under the background of the improvement of gene synthesis technology.

"There is no specific drug that has been approved for 2019-nCoV. There are a number of factors that pose major challenges in their development. Approaches to the development of anti-2019-nCoV include screening existing broad-spectrum antiviral drugs, repositioning of readily available clinical compounds, and de novo development of novel and specific agents for 2019-nCoV. Candidate compounds can be developed either to inhibit virus-based targets, such as RNA proteases, polymerase, spike glycoproteins, and viral envelop and membrane proteins, or to inhibit host-based targets, such as receptors and proteases that are utilized by virus for viral entry and endocytosis.

"The corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread throughout China and many other countries around the world. The antivirals are important measures to this epidemic; however, there is no drug approved for against coronavirus yet. With the continuously rising number of confirmed/suspected cases of COVID-19, it is urgent to obtain antiviral drugs for the clinical treatment. In response to this situation, drug repurposing strategy becomes one of the bests approach for anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug discovery.By retrieving the clinical trials registered in Chinese Clinical Trial Registry and ClinicalTrials.gov, a total of 14 chemical drugs were registered for COVID-19. In this review, we summarize and analyze the 14 drugs’ indications, targets, and research basis related to the activities against viral infections, esp. coronavirus infections. We are making efforts to understand the evidence basis of these drugs for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection applied by various research and clinical institutions in response to this COVID-19 outbreak, and also providing clues for quick response to possible epidemic in future and reasonable expansion of the indications of listed drugs."	张超;陈姝冰;张洁;郭颖	1032	药学学报	Acta Pharmaceutica Sinica	coronavirus; SARS-CoV-2; COVID-19; clinical trial; drug repurposing;	http://new.oversea.cnki.net/kcms/detail/11.2163.R.20200224.1100.001.html	浅析注册用于新冠肺炎治疗的临床试验药物	Title analysis of chemical drugs applied for clinical trial for the treatment of COVID-19
